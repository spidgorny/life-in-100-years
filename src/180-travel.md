## Travel

Since we don’t have country borders anymore, people can choose to live where they want. Since everybody has enough money, there’s no need to own the house. People can just pay a global rent - it’s like hotel subscription. Like WeWork for living houses. So you may chose to work from a nice place for some months. An ultimate digital nomad dream come true. Since most most computers are very powerful and inexpensive - they are available everywhere. You don’t need to travel with your notebook - any computer on the planet will allow you to login and will apply your personal settings upon login.

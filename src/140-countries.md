## Countries

Countries and border control is a relic from the past. The past when people lived in tribes (later cities, then countries). When people from a different tribe were coming for your resources and your life.

What sense is there in borders when everybody is having the same amount of UBI money, similar living conditions? The physical differences between people of different cities or races no longer play any role. Discrimination is forbidden already in 21st century.

What does it matter to me(!) which country my mother belongs to? Much more important is where do I feel the best, where can I express my potential the best.

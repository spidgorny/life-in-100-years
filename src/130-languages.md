## Languages

English has already established itself as am international language of science, internet and technology. I think by 2120 there will be almost nobody who does not speak English. Local languages will remain as well, but they will be spoken among family members and friends from your city. We will have mostly friends from around the world - English is the just the only language everybody understands.

That means that almost all people will be bilingual. This becomes the norm, more languages - more opportunities.

Chinese and Spanish have larger amount of speaker than English at the moment, but I’m sure English proficiency will grow.  They can’t beat the simplicity of English and the vast amount of scientific literature that is written in English.

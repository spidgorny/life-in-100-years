## Money

Let’s take the concept of universal basic income (UBI) and see how the life of people changes. **Nobody is required to work to live a decent live anymore.**  I think it’s  has huge consequences for the mental health of the people. Since the time when humans were animals the main concern was to survive. To find and store food and other resources. Resources were scarce, money were used to measure the value of the resources. Individuals with more money have access to more resources.

Psychologically this creates stress on everybody - we have to go to work to earn a living. Not going to work without a reason is not an option. Loosing job is a major factor that makes many people working in a position they don’t enjoy.  Some studies indicate that 85% of workers hate their job.

Even people who like their job, subconsciously feel the pressure - the need to be faster, stronger, clever, more productive. No wonder so many people suffer depression and other mental conditions.

This will not be a problem in 2120. Energy is abundant, food is grown by robots in vertical farms, houses are 3D-printed, self-driving cars carry you anywhere. If money will still survive - it will be rather used mostly for statistical analysis of the performance of the companies than as the means to survival for individuals. Having enough money for all your needs is like having no money - money becomes unnecessary.

Millions of people will feel a great psychological relief when UBI is introduces world-wide. Being a human is enough, you are enough. Enough to eat healthy food, have a moderate house and equipment. No need to work and not becoming a beggar is a dream come true in 2120.

Would not that lead to reduced competition and stagnation when everybody has nothing to do? We will come back to that question later.

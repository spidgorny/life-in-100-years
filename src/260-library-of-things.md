## Library of things

Most of the things I own are only used 1% of the time or less. I need to have a hammer, soldering iron, high-pressure washing device, camping gear, snowboarding gear, swimming gear, inline skates, a barbecue grill and a whole host of things for when I have visitors coming and so on. And my neighbour has a similar bunch of things he needs only occasionally. Not to mention the car - which is only driving

I guess it would be better that we share.

## Energy

We can characterise the human impact by the amount of energy available to the civilisation or individuals. For millions of years the only power humans had was in their muscles (legs and arms). It was much more important than today to be fit, be able to jump, run and hit.

With domestication of animals we could use the animals to do the work for us (horse power).

Over time, people found ways to force other people to work for them. Either as slaves or as paid workers. People with enough money can hire (buy) the power of hundreds of people. This is how the beautiful temples were built.

With time human invented different mechanisms, gears and levers and thus gained more power. That’s why the invention of steam engine is often called the industrial revolution. For the first time in millennia people started using a power of mechanisms without relying on muscles (animals or humans).

Electricity empowered humans (as a whole and individuals as well) to stratospheric heights. One horse power is 746 watts. A typical home in Germany is able to use (230 V * 32 A) 7360 watts. That’s about 10 clean horses that is available to every home.

The purpose of the electricity usage also changes with time. In 1900 most of the electricity was used to keep the lights on and power industrial machines. In 2000, turning on the lights is not a big deal, not even a small deal - we turn on the lights as simple as that.

As a humanity we use 120000 TWh per year. Most of it (38%) still comes from coal. [World energy consumption - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption)

Now we imagine year 2120. Fusion power is a reality since decades. This clean and cheap energy source removes many barriers to human endeavours. Providing electricity to every place on Earth is a given. Large infrastructure projects become possible. We may want to pump water to Sahara desert. Or capture CO2 from the atmosphere	 at a massive scale. We can dig underground highways between cities. Abundant energy will allow us to reverse the climate impact we had on the planet. We could probably pay with this energy for the damage that was already done.

The individual will also have vastly more power at his disposal. Powering a quantum computer at home will take some more energy that powering a laptop today.  Let’s see what else changes.

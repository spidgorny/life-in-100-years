## Cities

Living in a multi-million city was necessary when most people had to “go to work”. When work is mostly at home, enabled by the Internet - living in a large city becomes a burden. House prices are too high, air quality too low, a selection of 200 restaurants unnecessary, traffic is terrible. Would it not be better to live in smaller community? Not in a “village” as we know them from the past. Villages lack the infrastructure, technological advancement and are tightly linked to the “dirty” farming in our minds.

Imagine a small town as advanced as the best city. You’d have the services that are top-class in an area that’s accessible by bike. The bike lanes would be separated from roads and every town district would be connected by the green parks to every other district.

The concentration of best services in the centre would make less sense. It was historically more efficient for everybody to visit the centre for all their needs, but only because cities were constructed ad-hoc. If the layout of the city is planned in advance - each district can have a small centre with most necessary services: health care, food, library of things, entertainment…

City centres would not be dominated by offices, most people can work from home. There would not be much traffic in the centre, most people who go there would do that in 10 minute bicycle ride. You can always travel to a different city-hub for something special, but most of your needs would be fulfilled locally.

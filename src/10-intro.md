# Life in hundred years

It’s no surprise that we live in the tough times. I’m writing this in 2021 - in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the times like this it can be useful to look ahead at the future to gain more confidence and reduce stress. Who has the ability to shape the future? We have. When is the time to do it? Now.

> BTW, we all live in the present all the time. The concept of past and the future exists only in our head - the real world (including humans) lives now. You may imagine the future or think of the past (both in your head), but when you exit your thoughts and look around - you notice that the time is “now”. There’s no way to do anything except if you do it now.

-This mental exercise has a number of benefits:-

Everything that is made by humans has been imagined in the mind. Every bridge was thought of in the mind of the architect. Every piece of bread (even baked in the factory) was included in the cost/yield estimation when the factory was built. Every book written happened in the head of the author. And so on.

Humans are capable to think of something and then make conscious or unconscious step toward realisation of their idea. This way, it’s important to be aware of your thoughts, as some of them will influence what you will be doing.

Any way, I tried to imagine the future in 100 years. I’ve taken some of the novel ideas of 2020 decade and extrapolated them further. I am curious how the world would look like if these ideas become the mainstream and then daily reality. Let’s explore year 2120 together.

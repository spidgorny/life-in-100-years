## Automation

One more reason for not treating our children as future factory workers is this. All work that can be done by robots will be done by robots. This is logical - even most expensive robots are cheaper in the long term than humans with their needs for variety, novelty, food, meaning in life, labor unions, maximal working hours and minimal salary. We are living in the transition zone from human work to machine work. This transition looks scary for 3 million truck drivers in the U.S. But it’s inevitable, just like we don’t grow each our own food (farmers do it more efficiently), we don’t build our own house (building company is way more efficient and experienced). The same way we will not do jobs that can be done by machine or AI. It’s just counter-productive.

So we don’t need to train our children as workers. We should develop their higher qualities: fascination with life, desire to help others, life-long self-education, creativity, problem-solving, entrepreneurship, healthy diet, natural talents.

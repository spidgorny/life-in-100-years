## Human relations

Good relations between people become the norm in 2120. Nobody’s stressed about their boss or lack of funds, lack of health or opportunities. People try to use each other nowadays. Polite relations are often dictated by the need to gain advantage.

All of that will be long gone. People will meet other people with a genuine curiosity and ask “how are you” because they care, not as another phrase for “hello”.

Exploring human potential becomes the goal of the people. They are not born to work, but to explore the planet and life. People will still have natural interests in different topics and will explore different ways of life. The rule “born a carpenter - will die a carpenter” will no longer apply.

Some people will be naturally tended to guide newcomers into the topic (science discipline or place of interest). They will replace the teachers and professors.

## Education

Everybody knows that the education was invented by factory owners who needed trained workers. Our education 100 years later still bears the same design principles. Everybody is learning the same subjects, in the same pace regardless of their abilities and natural talents. The study time is split into equal classes 45 minutes long. Any differences in children are neglected or treated as deviation that needs punishment. It more seems like the education for robots than people.

I hope it would change in 2120. First of all, we need smaller classes. One teacher is unable to attend to needs and differences of 30 pupils at the same time as teaching them a lesson. A perfect class size should be determined experimentally, I would recommend to start with 10 pupils. A teacher should become a mentor. Teaching the exact scientific material should be only 1/3 of the duties. The rest should be a development supervision, knowledge nourishment and psychological development.

No wonder our schools produce mediocre people in droves. Thin about it - every child has a potential to become great. But only if this potential is recognised and cherished. Current schools do nothing of the kind. Itâ€™s a shame we deprive our society of the best people.

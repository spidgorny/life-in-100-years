## Surveillance

It’s bad news for freedom fighters. You could be on your own in the past if you travel long enough and there would be no supervision. There’s a tendency to impose police, laws and government everywhere. In 2120 you would be under supervision at all times. Your smart home needs to know when you are coming back, your smart kitchen needs to sense when you become hungry, the self-driving car will report all your movements to the server and your AI doctor needs to recommend you a new supplement when it senses your blood composition change. If we want the world to be convenient - we need to provide it with information about us. There’s no way around it.

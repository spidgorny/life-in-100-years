Even today in 2020, many people wear smartwatches that collect health data like steps and distance walked, sleep quality, pulse, blood saturation, etc. This data is visible in the app. And there are multiple apps that store data in different ways. The project like [Google Health](https://health.google/) is supposedly able to collect data from multiple providers, but not all smartwatch manufactures support it.

We are lacking the ability to share the data with our doctor. Even worse. Our doctor does not care the slightest about our sleep quality. Doctors only care about patients that show up in their office - because that's how they get paid. So even we could share the data with the doctor - he would not have any incentive to have a look at it. 

It looks like the health of the individual is in the hands of the individual. This is less than idea. Some of us neglect serious symptoms because we lack the knowledge or simply too busy, careless or hope it will go away soon. Others are hypochondriacs - going to the doctor unnecessarily.

I hope in 100 years we will have AI systems that monitor our health using various sensors. Doctors will receive warnings for situations they need to access. Patients will be proactively contacted by doctors asking for our mental state or other symptoms and schedule and appointment with the patient (currently it's other-way around).

We need to set our intentions straight. Currently, we pay doctors for keeping patients healthy enough, so they don't die, but keep coming to appointments so that the insurance company pays for that.

Doctors need to paid for the lack of sick patients - maybe we become healthier this way.

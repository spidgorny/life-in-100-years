## Food production

There can be small farms between the city-hubs. It depends a lot on the topography. In other places the farms can be huge and operated by robots.    Vertical farming makes sense. The earth has a 2D surface. And for millennia it was common sense to spread horizontally when more farm land was needed. With cheap robotic building construction methods it becomes more efficient to grow farming in the 3rd dimension.

All the water that you pour on your crops in a flat farm goes underground and disappears from your control. In the vertical farm you can let it drip to the level below, and then below that. Vertical farming reduces water requirement by 80%.

It becomes mind-boggling to fertilise the soil that is not under your control. Rains wash the fertiliser away, birds eat your produce, winds and bad weather destroy whole fields. Vertical farming gives you a controlled environment, which saves you water, fertiliser and efforts. The only cost is electricity to replace the sun in an enclosed floors. But we discussed that electricity is abundant in 2120 already.

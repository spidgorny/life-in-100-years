## P.S.

I’ve tried to think independently and present my view on the life in the future. But later I realised that many of these ideas are similar or identical to the work of Jaques Fresco. Fresco was born one generation too early. People were not ready for his ideas in 1980es. He was preaching, but nobody would take him seriously.

Even though my ideas are not new - so what? It’s even better that good ideas are repeated, they give a sense of a direction for the development. Anyway, not many people are aware of the ideas of Jaques Fresco as well as with ideas of Elon Musk. I think they are worth repeating.

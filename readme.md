# Life in hundred years

It’s no surprise that we live in the tough times. I’m writing this in 2021 - in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the times like this it can be useful to look ahead at the future to gain more confidence and reduce stress. Who has the ability to shape the future? We have. When is the time to do it? Now.

> BTW, we all live in the present all the time. The concept of past and the future exists only in our head - the real world (including humans) lives now. You may imagine the future or think of the past (both in your head), but when you exit your thoughts and look around - you notice that the time is “now”. There’s no way to do anything except if you do it now.

-This mental exercise has a number of benefits:-

Everything that is made by humans has been imagined in the mind. Every bridge was thought of in the mind of the architect. Every piece of bread (even baked in the factory) was included in the cost/yield estimation when the factory was built. Every book written happened in the head of the author. And so on.

Humans are capable to think of something and then make conscious or unconscious step toward realisation of their idea. This way, it’s important to be aware of your thoughts, as some of them will influence what you will be doing.

Any way, I tried to imagine the future in 100 years. I’ve taken some of the novel ideas of 2020 decade and extrapolated them further. I am curious how the world would look like if these ideas become the mainstream and then daily reality. Let’s explore year 2120 together.
## Energy

We can characterise the human impact by the amount of energy available to the civilisation or individuals. For millions of years the only power humans had was in their muscles (legs and arms). It was much more important than today to be fit, be able to jump, run and hit.

With domestication of animals we could use the animals to do the work for us (horse power).

Over time, people found ways to force other people to work for them. Either as slaves or as paid workers. People with enough money can hire (buy) the power of hundreds of people. This is how the beautiful temples were built.

With time human invented different mechanisms, gears and levers and thus gained more power. That’s why the invention of steam engine is often called the industrial revolution. For the first time in millennia people started using a power of mechanisms without relying on muscles (animals or humans).

Electricity empowered humans (as a whole and individuals as well) to stratospheric heights. One horse power is 746 watts. A typical home in Germany is able to use (230 V * 32 A) 7360 watts. That’s about 10 clean horses that is available to every home.

The purpose of the electricity usage also changes with time. In 1900 most of the electricity was used to keep the lights on and power industrial machines. In 2000, turning on the lights is not a big deal, not even a small deal - we turn on the lights as simple as that.

As a humanity we use 120000 TWh per year. Most of it (38%) still comes from coal. [World energy consumption - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption)

- - - -
Now we imagine year 2120. Fusion power is a reality since decades. This clean and cheap energy source removes many barriers to human endeavours. Providing electricity to every place on Earth is a given. Large infrastructure projects become possible. We may want to pump water to Sahara desert. Or capture CO2 from the atmosphere	 at a massive scale. We can dig underground highways between cities. Abundant energy will allow us to reverse the climate impact we had on the planet. We could probably pay with this energy for the damage that was already done.

The individual will also have vastly more power at his disposal. Powering a quantum computer at home will take some more energy that powering a laptop today.  Let’s see what else changes.

## Money

Let’s take the concept of universal basic income (UBI) and see how the life of people changes. **Nobody is required to work to live a decent live anymore.**  I think it’s  has huge consequences for the mental health of the people. Since the time when humans were animals the main concern was to survive. To find and store food and other resources. Resources were scarce, money were used to measure the value of the resources. Individuals with more money have access to more resources.

Psychologically this creates stress on everybody - we have to go to work to earn a living. Not going to work without a reason is not an option. Loosing job is a major factor that makes many people working in a position they don’t enjoy.  Some studies indicate that 85% of workers hate their job. [Why 85% of People Hate their Jobs | Staff Squared](https://www.staffsquared.com/blog/why-85-of-people-hate-their-jobs/)

Even people who like their job, subconsciously feel the pressure - the need to be faster, stronger, clever, more productive. No wonder so many people suffer depression and other mental conditions.

- - - -
This will not be a problem in 2120. Energy is abundant, food is grown by robots in vertical farms, houses are 3D-printed, self-driving cars carry you anywhere. If money will still survive - it will be rather used mostly for statistical analysis of the performance of the companies than as the means to survival for individuals. Having enough money for all your needs is like having no money - money becomes unnecessary.

Millions of people will feel a great psychological relief when UBI is introduces world-wide. Being a human is enough, you are enough. Enough to eat healthy food, have a moderate house and equipment. No need to work and not becoming a beggar is a dream come true in 2120.

Would not that lead to reduced competition and stagnation when everybody has nothing to do? We will come back to that question later.

## Countries

Countries and border control is a relic from the past. The past when people lived in tribes (later cities, then countries). When people from a different tribe were coming for your resources and your life.

What sense is there in borders when everybody is having the same amount of UBI money, similar living conditions? The physical differences between people of different cities or races no longer play any role. Discrimination is forbidden already in 21st century.

What does it matter to me(!) which country my mother belongs to? Much more important is where do I feel the best, where can I express my potential the best.
## Human relations

Good relations between people become the norm in 2120. Nobody’s stressed about their boss or lack of funds, lack of health or opportunities. People try to use each other nowadays. Polite relations are often dictated by the need to gain advantage.

All of that will be long gone. People will meet other people with a genuine curiosity and ask “how are you” because they care, not as another phrase for “hello”.

Exploring human potential becomes the goal of the people. They are not born to work, but to explore the planet and life. People will still have natural interests in different topics and will explore different ways of life. The rule “born a carpenter - will die a carpenter” will no longer apply.

Some people will be naturally tended to guide newcomers into the topic (science discipline or place of interest). They will replace the teachers and professors. 

## Work from home

With super-fast Internet connection and awesome VR, there’s not need to commute to the office every day. Working from home becomes the norm. Some large events may need to have people gather together. 

## Transportation

Self-driving car? It’s too long term for something self-evident. All cars are self-driving. With some rare exceptions - just like we still have horse stables today - just for fun. There’s less need to travel for daily work, but if necessary, you can order self-driving car to move you around.

## Travel

Since we don’t have country borders anymore, people can choose to live where they want. Since everybody has enough money, there’s no need to own the house. People can just pay a global rent - it’s like hotel subscription. Like WeWork for living houses. So you may chose to work from a nice place for some months. An ultimate digital nomad dream come true. Since most most computers are very powerful and inexpensive - they are available everywhere. You don’t need to travel with your notebook - any computer on the planet will allow you to login and will apply your personal settings upon login.

## Laws

Laws would be united. I already have a feeling that many countries base their laws on U.S. examples. This can come to the united global laws. The cases like 1970 T-3 would not be a problem anymore.  [A bizarre 1970 Arctic killing and the looming problem of criminal justice in space.](https://slate.com/technology/2020/07/arctic-t3-murder-space.html)

## Surveillance

It’s bad news for freedom fighters. You could be on your own in the past if you travel long enough and there would be no supervision. There’s a tendency to impose police, laws and government everywhere. In 2120 you would be under supervision at all times. Your smart home needs to know when you are coming back, your smart kitchen needs to sense when you become hungry, the self-driving car will report all your movements to the server and your AI doctor needs to recommend you a new supplement when it senses your blood composition change. If we want the world to be convenient - we need to provide it with information about us. There’s no way around it.

## Education

Everybody knows that the education was invented by factory owners who needed trained workers. Our education 100 years later still bears the same design principles. Everybody is learning the same subjects, in the same pace regardless of their abilities and natural talents. The study time is split into equal classes 45 minutes long. Any differences in children are neglected or treated as deviation that needs punishment. It more seems like the education for robots than people.

I hope it would change in 2120. First of all, we need smaller classes. One teacher is unable to attend to needs and differences of 30 pupils at the same time as teaching them a lesson. A perfect class size should be determined experimentally, I would recommend to start with 10 pupils. A teacher should become a mentor. Teaching the exact scientific material should be only 1/3 of the duties. The rest should be a development supervision, knowledge nourishment and psychological development.

No wonder our schools produce mediocre people in droves. Thin about it - every child has a potential to become great. But only if this potential is recognised and cherished. Current schools do nothing of the kind. It’s a shame we deprive our society of the best people.

(Jaques Fresco quote about single Einstein in a century)
## Automation

One more reason for not treating our children as future factory workers is this. All work that can be done by robots will be done by robots. This is logical - even most expensive robots are cheaper in the long term than humans with their needs for variety, novelty, food, meaning in life, labor unions, maximal working hours and minimal salary. We are living in the transition zone from human work to machine work. This transition looks scary for 3 million truck drivers in the U.S. But it’s inevitable, just like we don’t grow each our own food (farmers do it more efficiently), we don’t build our own house (building company is way more efficient and experienced). The same way we will not do jobs that can be done by machine or AI. It’s just counter-productive.

So we don’t need to train our children as workers. We should develop their higher qualities: fascination with life, desire to help others, life-long self-education, creativity, problem-solving, entrepreneurship, healthy diet, natural talents.

## Languages

English has already established itself as am international language of science, internet and technology. I think by 2120 there will be almost nobody who does not speak English. Local languages will remain as well, but they will be spoken among family members and friends from your city. We will have mostly friends from around the world - English is the just the only language everybody understands.

That means that almost all people will be bilingual. This becomes the norm, more languages - more opportunities.

Chinese and Spanish have larger amount of speaker than English at the moment, but I’m sure English proficiency will grow.  They can’t beat the simplicity of English and the vast amount of scientific literature that is written in English.
## Cities

Living in a multi-million city was necessary when most people had to “go to work”. When work is mostly at home, enabled by the Internet - living in a large city becomes a burden. House prices are too high, air quality too low, a selection of 200 restaurants unnecessary, traffic is terrible. Would it not be better to live in smaller community? Not in a “village” as we know them from the past. Villages lack the infrastructure, technological advancement and are tightly linked to the “dirty” farming in our minds.

Imagine a small town as advanced as the best city. You’d have the services that are top-class in an area that’s accessible by bike. The bike lanes would be separated from roads and every town district would be connected by the green parks to every other district.

The concentration of best services in the centre would make less sense. It was historically more efficient for everybody to visit the centre for all their needs, but only because cities were constructed ad-hoc. If the layout of the city is planned in advance - each district can have a small centre with most necessary services: health care, food, library of things, entertainment…

City centres would not be dominated by offices, most people can work from home. There would not be much traffic in the centre, most people who go there would do that in 10 minute bicycle ride. You can always travel to a different city-hub for something special, but most of your needs would be fulfilled locally.

## Food production

There can be small farms between the city-hubs. It depends a lot on the topography. In other places the farms can be huge and operated by robots.    Vertical farming makes sense. The earth has a 2D surface. And for millennia it was common sense to spread horizontally when more farm land was needed. With cheap robotic building construction methods it becomes more efficient to grow farming in the 3rd dimension.

All the water that you pour on your crops in a flat farm goes underground and disappears from your control. In the vertical farm you can let it drip to the level below, and then below that. Vertical farming reduces water requirement by 80%. [What You Should Know About Vertical Farming](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/what-you-should-know-about-vertical-farming-4144786#:~:text=Less%20Use%20Of%20Water%20In,7%EF%BB%BF)

It becomes mind-boggling to fertilise the soil that is not under your control. Rains wash the fertiliser away, birds eat your produce, winds and bad weather destroy whole fields. Vertical farming gives you a controlled environment, which saves you water, fertiliser and efforts. The only cost is electricity to replace the sun in an enclosed floors. But we discussed that electricity is abundant in 2120 already.

## Library of things

Most of the things I own are only used 1% of the time or less. I need to have a hammer, soldering iron, high-pressure washing device, camping gear, snowboarding gear, swimming gear, inline skates, a barbecue grill and a whole host of things for when I have visitors coming and so on. And my neighbour has a similar bunch of things he needs only occasionally. Not to mention the car - which is only driving

I guess it would be better that we share.
# Health

Even today in 2020, many people wear smartwatches that collect health data like steps and distance walked, sleep quality, pulse, blood saturation, etc. This data is visible in the app. And there are multiple apps that store data in different ways. The project like [Google Health](https://health.google/) is supposedly able to collect data from multiple providers, but not all smartwatch manufactures support it.

We are lacking the ability to share the data with our doctor. Even worse. Our doctor does not care the slightest about our sleep quality. Doctors only care about patients that show up in their office - because that's how they get paid. So even we could share the data with the doctor - he would not have any incentive to have a look at it. 

It looks like the health of the individual is in the hands of the individual. This is less than idea. Some of us neglect serious symptoms because we lack the knowledge or simply too busy, careless or hope it will go away soon. Others are hypochondriacs - going to the doctor unnecessarily.

I hope in 100 years we will have AI systems that monitor our health using various sensors. Doctors will receive warnings for situations they need to access. Patients will be proactively contacted by doctors asking for our mental state or other symptoms and schedule and appointment with the patient (currently it's other-way around).

We need to set our intentions straight. Currently, we pay doctors for keeping patients healthy enough, so they don't die, but keep coming to appointments so that the insurance company pays for that.

Doctors need to paid for the lack of sick patients - maybe we become healthier this way.
## P.S.

I’ve tried to think independently and present my view on the life in the future. But later I realised that many of these ideas are similar or identical to the work of Jaques Fresco. Fresco was born one generation too early. People were not ready for his ideas in 1980es. He was preaching, but nobody would take him seriously.

Even though my ideas are not new - so what? It’s even better that good ideas are repeated, they give a sense of a direction for the development. Anyway, not many people are aware of the ideas of Jaques Fresco as well as with ideas of Elon Musk. I think they are worth repeating.
